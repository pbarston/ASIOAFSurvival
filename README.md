Survival Analysis for George R.R. Martin's ASOIAF Universe

I figured the best way to keep my coding skills sharp this summer would be to put them to the ultimate test: making sense of all that bloodletting in George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" universe. 

Over the course of multiple weeks over at my blog (bitly.com/pbarston), I dug into ASOIAF to figure out how to best visualize and then predict survival rates among characters.

Special thanks to the work done by Myles O'Neill to compile a few disparate datasets from the ASOIAF universe here (https://www.kaggle.com/mylesoneill/game-of-thrones?select=character-deaths.csv) - specifically, that "character-deaths.csv" from Erin Pierce and Ben Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival Analysis which can be found here: http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html. Thanks, Erin and Ben!

The dataset is a list of the 917 characters identified in the first five books along with their house allegiances (if noted), information on their death (year, book, chapter), the chapter (but importantly, not the book) of their first appearance, and some biographical info (gender, nobility) as well as a boolean appear/not appear in each of the five books.

Please see my full code for the steps to complete as well as my blog (bitly.com/pbarston) for specific findings.

Where would you take the analysis next? Will GRRM ever publish? Reach out to me and let me know!
